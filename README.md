Welcome to XGhost Spammer V 2.3.0, an advanced Parallel GUI spamming program designed for optimal performance and security. Developed in 2020, this software prioritizes simplicity and ease of use while offering cutting-edge features.

## Key Features

- **Direct Inbox Delivery:** XGhost Spammer ensures that your emails are directly delivered to the recipient's main inbox, bypassing spam filters and enhancing the visibility of your messages.

- **SSL-Encrypted Sender Data:** Your sender data is securely transmitted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, establishing a protected link between the server and client. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of your transmitted information.

- **No Usage Limits:** Unlike other API-based solutions, XGhost Spammer comes without usage or scheduling limits. Enjoy unmatched freedom with no restrictions on the number of emails you can send.

- **Time Scheduling:** Schedule your email campaigns with precision using the time delay option, enhancing professionalism and control over your spamming campaigns.

- **Send to Multiple Recipients:** XGhost Spammer now supports sending emails to multiple recipients using a hidden feature. In the input field, specify multiple email addresses separated by the pipe symbol `|`. For example:
email1@example.com|email2@example.com|email3@example.com

## Important Notes

- **User Responsibility:** Use this program responsibly and exclusively with your own Gmail account. The program developer disclaims any responsibility for potential damage caused by the program's usage.

- **Connection Challenges:** If you encounter difficulties connecting to a Gmail account, please ensure the entered password is the app password generated by Gmail (16 digits) and not the default password. Refer to the program's information for detailed instructions.

- **Antivirus Considerations:** If you encounter issues, it is recommended to temporarily disable your antivirus. For further details, consult the program's information section.
- **Parallel Spamming Limitations:** Kindly note that parallel spamming from different Gmail accounts may not function as expected. This is due to Gmail discontinuing support for less secure apps in May 2022 to enhance account security along with API changes.
